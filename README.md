*# The NF-PP Unified Theory*



*This repository contains the foundational mathematical framework for the NF-PP Unified Theory, a new model of physics that proposes a single, all-encompassing explanation for the universe's fundamental forces and cosmic dynamics.*



*This work redefines core concepts such as:*

# *- Gravity as a pressure gradient, not a pull.*

*- The universe's expansion as a repulsive event, not a singular Big Bang.*

*- The strong and weak forces as local field instabilities.*

*- All forces as consequences of, and or from the inneractions of the repulsive Negative Field (NF) and the state, position, and motion of the positve particles (pp) within the field.*



*For a detailed explanation of the theory's principles and derivations, please see the `NF-PP\_Mathematical\_Framework.md` file.*
